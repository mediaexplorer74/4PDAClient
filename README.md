## About
I have some plans to "recover" 4PDA-for-W10M. :)

My attempt to remake fully discontinued & obsolete [ForPDA](https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?showtopic=478458#entry23314163) for WP7 app. 


## About
Very early bird; draft UWP application to "parse" 4PDA web site on some winphone with Windows 10 Mobile os...


## Tech/dev details

- Targets: x64; ARM
- OSes: Windows 10 (Mobile) ; build: 14393 or above

## Status
- Draft. Prototype / Pre-Pre-Pre-Alpha version.
